mipsim - A partial MIPS emulator

mipsim reads commands from standard input and can run
instructions like a MIPS processor.

Commands can alter/display registers or memory values,
or run some number of instructions.

Supported commands and formats are:
_____________________________________________________________________
            |
rN          | show in hex the contents of register N
            |
rN = <HEX>  | set the contents of register N to the given hexdecimal value
            |
m <HEX>     | show contents of the word (4 bytes) at the given hexdecimal address
            |
m <A> = <V> | set the word at address <A> to <V>, both in hex
            |
pc          | show contents of the Pc (program counter) register
            |
pc = <HEX>  | set the PC to the given hexdecimal value
            |
.           | execute one instruction
            |
. N         | execute N instructions
            |
q           | exit the program (also exits on end-of-file)
            |

Some whitespace variations are permitted, do not rely on this however.

At mipsim start, all registers and memory is initialised to zero.
